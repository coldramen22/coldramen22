howdy, i'm  @coldramen22 and on my hunt for a new personalit trait i remembered my deep seeded love for html
- 👀 i'm interested in...using code to make things pretty. i want to focus on html and css first, move into ui and data management (presentation? idk how to explain making a spreadsheet an aesthetic moment) and explore lightweight app design for my future in project management. or real estate. or maybe i have what it takes to make it in this overly saturated "self as sale" market. who knows?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of git!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools that will help me learn. what repo's do i absolutely need to mull over? what podcasts feature informative yet personable hosts? are coders nice?
