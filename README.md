# howdy, i'm  @coldramen22 
and on my hunt for a new personality trait i remembered my deep seeded love for html


- üëÄ i'm interested in...using code to make things pretty. i want to focus on html and css first, move into ui and data management (presentation? idk how to explain making a spreadsheet an aesthetic moment) and explore lightweight app design for my future in project management. or real estate. or maybe i have what it takes to make it in this overly saturated "self as sale" market. who knows?
-   more seriously, i am passionate about open source, clean code, and networked notetaking principles. I believe these elements are crucial for enhancing programmer thinking and fostering a collaborative and efficient development environment.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning the very basics typescript
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on tools that will help me learn. what repo's do i absolutely need to mull over? what podcasts feature informative yet personable hosts? are coders nice?


## Principles and Philosophy

### Open Source

Open source is more than just a way to share code; it's a philosophy that promotes transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development. By contributing to open source projects, I can:

- **Learn and Grow**: Collaborating with developers worldwide exposes me to diverse perspectives and innovative solutions.
- **Give Back**: Sharing my work helps others, just as I benefit from the contributions of the community.
- **Build Trust**: Open source projects are transparent, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and improve the code.

### Clean Code

Clean code is the foundation of maintainable and scalable software. It emphasizes readability, simplicity, and elegance. The principles of clean code include:

- **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand, making it accessible to other developers.
- **Simplicity**: Avoiding unnecessary complexity ensures that the code is straightforward and efficient.
- **Consistency**: Following consistent coding standards and practices helps maintain uniformity across the project.

The philosophy behind clean code is to create software that is not only functional but also a joy to work with. It reduces technical debt and makes future enhancements easier.

### Networked Notetaking

Networked notetaking is a method of organizing and connecting ideas to enhance understanding and creativity. It involves:

- **Linking Concepts**: Connecting related notes helps build a web of knowledge, making it easier to see relationships and patterns.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Notes are enriched with context, providing deeper insights and facilitating better decision-making.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly revisiting and refining notes ensures that knowledge stays relevant and up-to-date.

The philosophy of networked notetaking is to create a dynamic and interconnected knowledge base that evolves with my learning journey. It supports critical thinking and problem-solving by making information more accessible and meaningful.
